# Using Helm to Install Components to Docker

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, and it is typically used to manage Kubernetes applications. However, you can use Helm charts to define and manage the deployment of applications in a Kubernetes cluster running on Docker.

Here is a basic outline of how you can use Helm with Docker:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
2. **Install Kubernetes**: Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube or Docker Desktop.
3. **Install Helm**: Download and install Helm on your machine.
4. **Add Helm Repositories**: Add the necessary Helm repositories.
5. **Deploy with Helm**: Use Helm to deploy applications to your Kubernetes cluster running on Docker.

## Example Steps

1. **Install Docker**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
    ```

2. **Install Minikube**:
    ```sh
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
    minikube start
    ```

3. **Install Helm**:
    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
    ```

4. **Add a Helm Repository**:
    ```sh
    helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
    helm repo update
    ```

5. **Deploy an Application**:
    ```sh
    helm install my-release stable/nginx
    ```

This will deploy the NGINX application to your local Kubernetes cluster running on Docker.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the official Helm and Kubernetes documentation.
