## Thanos Sidecar Deployment

The `thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml` file is used to deploy the Thanos Sidecar in a Minikube environment. This deployment configuration includes the necessary specifications for running the Thanos Sidecar alongside Prometheus.

### Key Components

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version, typically `apps/v1`.
- **kind**: Defines the type of Kubernetes object, in this case, `Deployment`.
- **metadata**: Contains metadata about the deployment, such as `name` and `labels`.
- **spec**: Describes the desired state of the deployment, including:
    - **replicas**: Number of pod replicas.
    - **selector**: Label selector for the pods.
    - **template**: Pod template specification, which includes:
        - **metadata**: Metadata for the pods.
        - **spec**: Pod specification, including containers, volumes, and other settings.

### Example

Here is a simplified example of what the `thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml` might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: thanos-sidecar
    labels:
        app: thanos
spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: thanos
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: thanos
        spec:
            containers:
            - name: thanos-sidecar
                image: thanosio/thanos:latest
                args:
                - sidecar
                - --prometheus.url=http://prometheus:9090
                ports:
                - containerPort: 10902
```

This example includes the basic structure and key fields required for deploying the Thanos Sidecar.

### Troubleshooting Thanos Sidecar Deployment

To troubleshoot the `thanos-sidecar` deployment, you can use the `kubectl describe` command to get more details about the deployment and its current state. This command provides information about the events, conditions, and other relevant details that can help identify the issue.

```sh
kubectl describe deployment thanos-sidecar -n monitoring
```

- **Pod Status**: The status of the pods created by the deployment, including any errors or warnings.

By examining the output of this command, you can identify potential issues and take appropriate actions to resolve them.

### Common Issues

Here are some common issues that might cause the `thanos-sidecar` deployment to have 0 available replicas:

- **Image Pull Errors**: Ensure that the image `thanosio/thanos:latest` is available and can be pulled by the Kubernetes nodes.
- **Configuration Errors**: Verify that the configuration in the `thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml` file is correct and does not contain any syntax errors.
- **Resource Constraints**: Check if there are sufficient resources (CPU, memory) available on the nodes to schedule the pods.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that the network configuration allows the Thanos Sidecar to communicate with Prometheus and other components.

By addressing these common issues, you can increase the chances of successfully deploying the Thanos Sidecar.
