### Setting Up a Proof of Concept Project with Prometheus and Thanos in GitHub Codespaces 🚀

In the world of cloud-based development environments, GitHub Codespaces offers a powerful platform for setting up and testing various projects. Today, we'll walk through creating a proof of concept (PoC) project with Prometheus and Thanos, complete with emojis to make the process more engaging! 🌟

#### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Codespaces

1. **Create a Repository**:
   - Start by creating a new repository on GitHub for your PoC project. 📂

2. **Open in Codespaces**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`.
   - Create a new Codespace or open an existing one. 🚀

#### Step 2: Prepare the Environment

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running in your Codespace. 🐳

2. **Create a Docker Compose File**:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services for Prometheus and Thanos.

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"

  thanos-sidecar:
    image: quay.io/thanos/thanos:latest
    command:
      - sidecar
      - --tsdb.path=/var/prometheus
      - --prometheus.url=http://prometheus:9090
      - --grpc-address=0.0.0.0:10901
      - --http-address=0.0.0.0:10902
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus-data:/var/prometheus
    depends_on:
      - prometheus
    ports:
      - "10901:10901"
      - "10902:10902"

  thanos-query:
    image: quay.io/thanos/thanos:latest
    command:
      - query
      - --http-address=0.0.0.0:9091
      - --store=thanos-sidecar:10901
    depends_on:
      - thanos-sidecar
    ports:
      - "9091:9091"
```

3. **Create Prometheus Configuration**:
   - Create a `prometheus.yml` file to configure Prometheus.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

#### Step 3: Run the Services

1. **Start Docker Compose**:
   - Run the following command to start the services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Access Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090`. 🌐
   - Access Thanos Query at `http://localhost:9091`. 🌐

#### Step 4: Test the Setup

1. **Add Metrics**:
   - Add some sample metrics to Prometheus and verify they are being scraped. 📊

2. **Query Metrics**:
   - Use Thanos Query to query the metrics stored in Prometheus. 🔍

#### Step 5: Clean Up

1. **Stop the Services**:
   - Run the following command to stop the services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up a proof of concept project with Prometheus and Thanos in GitHub Codespaces. This setup allows you to explore the integration and capabilities of these tools in a cloud-based development environment. Happy coding! 🎉
