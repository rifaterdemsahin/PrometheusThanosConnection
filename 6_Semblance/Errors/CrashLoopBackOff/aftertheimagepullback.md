>>>>> ImagePull Error Turned into Crash Loopback 
monitoring    thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-wzksf    0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   6 (2m22s ago)   8m31s



### How to Resolve It

1. **Check Image Name and Tag**: Ensure that the image name and tag are correct in your Kubernetes deployment YAML file.

2. **Verify Image Availability**: Confirm that the image is available in the container registry you are using. You can do this by trying to pull the image manually using `docker pull <image-name>:<tag>`.

3. **Inspect Network Policies**: Check if there are any network policies or firewall rules that might be blocking access to the container registry.

4. **Check Kubernetes Node Resources**: Ensure that the nodes have enough resources (CPU, memory) to pull and run the image.

5. **Review Kubernetes Events**: Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to get more details about the error and review the events section for any clues.
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

kubectl describe pod thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-wzksf

Error from server (NotFound): pods "thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-wzksf" not found


6. **Check Pod Deletion**: The error message `Error from server (NotFound): pods "thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-wzksf" not found` indicates that the pod might have been deleted or recreated by Kubernetes. Verify if the pod still exists by running `kubectl get pods -A` again. If the pod has been recreated, use the new pod name for further troubleshooting.


6. **Update Image Pull Secrets**: If your container registry requires authentication, make sure that the image pull secrets are correctly configured in your Kubernetes cluster.

7. **Restart the Pod**: Sometimes, simply deleting the pod and allowing Kubernetes to recreate it can resolve transient issues. Use `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`.

8. **Check for Disk Space**: Ensure that there is enough disk space on the nodes to pull the image.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the CrashLoopBackOff issue caused by an ImagePull error.

### Explanation of the Pod Status

The `kubectl describe pod thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-wzksf -n monitoring` command provides detailed information about the pod `thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-wzksf` in the `monitoring` namespace. Here are some key points to understand from the output:

- **Pod Status**: The pod is in a `Running` state, but the container within it is experiencing a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. This means the container is repeatedly crashing and being restarted by Kubernetes.
- **Container State**: The container `thanos-sidecar` is in a `Waiting` state with the reason `CrashLoopBackOff`. The last state of the container was `Terminated` with an `Error` reason and an exit code of `1`, indicating that the container encountered an error and exited.
- **Restart Count**: The container has been restarted 7 times, which is a clear sign of a crash loop.
- **Events**: The events section shows that the container has been successfully scheduled, pulled, created, and started multiple times, but it keeps failing and entering a back-off state.

### Possible Causes and Next Steps

1. **Application Error**: The container might be crashing due to an error in the application code. Check the application logs for any error messages.
2. **Resource Limits**: Ensure that the pod has sufficient CPU and memory resources allocated.
3. **Configuration Issues**: Verify that the configuration files and environment variables are correctly set.
4. **Dependencies**: Check if the container has all the necessary dependencies and services available.

By addressing these potential issues, you can resolve the `CrashLoopBackOff` state and stabilize the pod.

### Increasing the Number of Cores in GitHub Codespaces

To increase the number of cores in your GitHub Codespaces environment, follow these steps:

1. **Open Codespaces Settings**:
    - Navigate to your GitHub repository.
    - Click on the `Code` button and then select `Codespaces`.
    - Click on the `...` (three dots) next to your active Codespace and select `Configure`.

2. **Select a Machine Type**:
    - In the configuration settings, you will see an option to choose the machine type.
    - Select a machine type with more cores. For example, you can choose a `4-core` or `8-core` machine depending on your requirements.

3. **Save and Restart**:
    - Save the configuration changes.
    - Restart your Codespace to apply the new settings.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how you can specify the machine type in your `.devcontainer.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "My Codespace",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:0-focal",
  "settings": {},
  "extensions": [],
  "postCreateCommand": "echo 'Setup complete!'",
  "remoteUser": "vscode",
  "features": {},
  "hostRequirements": {
     "cpus": 4,
     "memory": "8gb"
  }
}
```

By following these steps, you can increase the number of cores available in your GitHub Codespaces environment, allowing for better performance and faster execution of tasks.
