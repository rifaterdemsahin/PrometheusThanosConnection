rifaterdemsahin: Write the external labels that is needed for the sidecar deployment in minikube

Would you like to set them up?

rifaterdemsahin: @workspace /tests Dismiss: "It looks like you may not have tests set up in this repository yet."

Workspace: ### Plan

1. Create a test file `test_labels_external.md`.
2. Write tests to verify that the external labels are correctly configured for the Thanos sidecar deployment in Minikube.

### Tests

 Test 1: Check if external labels are defined
1. **Description**: Ensure that the external labels are defined in the Prometheus configuration.
2. **Expected Result**: External labels should be present and correctly formatted.
3. **Test Steps**:
    - Open the Prometheus configuration file.
    - Verify that the `external_labels` section is present.
    - Check that the labels include `cluster` and `region`.

## Test 2: Validate External Labels Values
1. **Description**: Ensure that the values for the external labels are correctly set.
2. **Expected Result**: The values for `cluster` and `region` should match the expected values.
3. **Test Steps**:
    - Open the Prometheus configuration file.
    - Verify that the `external_labels` section contains the correct values for `cluster` and `region`.
    - Example:
      ```yaml
      external_labels:
         cluster: "your-cluster-name"
         region: "your-region"
      ```

## Test 6: Force Apply Prometheus Configuration
1. **Description**: Ensure that the Prometheus configuration is forcefully applied to the Minikube cluster.
2. **Expected Result**: The Prometheus configuration should be applied without errors.
3. **Test Steps**:
  - Run the following command to force apply the Prometheus configuration:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -n monitoring -f /workspaces/PrometheusThanosConnection/5_Symbols/SymbolsMinikube/prometheus-config.yaml --force
    ```
  - Verify that the configuration is applied successfully by checking the status of the Prometheus pods.
  - Example command to check pod status:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n monitoring
    ```

## Test 3: Check Thanos Sidecar Logs for External Labels
1. **Description**: Ensure that the Thanos sidecar logs indicate successful loading of external labels.
2. **Expected Result**: The logs should show that the external labels are loaded successfully.
3. **Test Steps**:
    - Deploy the Thanos sidecar.
    - Check the logs of the Thanos sidecar pod.
    - Verify that the logs contain a message indicating successful loading of external labels.
    - Example log entry:
      ```
      ts=2024-10-22T13:48:21.593404086Z caller=sidecar.go:238 level=info msg="successfully loaded prometheus external labels" external_labels="{cluster=\"your-cluster-name\", region=\"your-region\"}"
      ```

## Test 4: Validate Thanos Sidecar Deployment
1. **Description**: Ensure that the Thanos sidecar deployment is correctly configured with the external labels.
2. **Expected Result**: The Thanos sidecar deployment should include the necessary arguments for external labels.
3. **Test Steps**:
    - Open the Thanos sidecar deployment YAML file.
    - Verify that the deployment includes the necessary arguments for external labels.
    - Example:
      ```yaml
      args:
      - sidecar
      - --tsdb.path=/var/prometheus
      - --prometheus.url=http://prometheus:9090
      - --grpc-address=0.0.0.0:10901
      - --http-address=0.0.0.0:10902
      - --label=cluster=your-cluster-name
      - --label=region=your-region
      ```

## Test 5: Check Prometheus Configuration for External Labels
1. **Description**: Ensure that the Prometheus configuration includes the external labels.
2. **Expected Result**: The Prometheus configuration should have the external labels defined.
3. **Test Steps**:
    - Open the Prometheus configuration file.
    - Verify that the `external_labels` section is present and correctly configured.
    - Example:
      ```yaml
      global:
         external_labels:
            cluster: "your-cluster-name"
            region: "your-region"
      ```
