### Steps to Resolve Image Pull Error

1. **Verify Image Name and Tag**:
   - Ensure the image name and tag specified in your deployment YAML file are correct and exist in the registry.

2. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure your Kubernetes nodes have network access to the image registry.

3. **Authenticate with Registry**:
   - If the image is in a private registry, ensure you have configured the necessary credentials.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Verify Image Name and Tag

Check the image name and tag in your `thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: thanos-sidecar
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: thanos-sidecar
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: thanos-sidecar
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: thanos-sidecar
        image: quay.io/thanos/thanos:v0.35.1  # Ensure this is the correct image and tag
        args:
        - sidecar
        - --tsdb.path=/var/prometheus
        - --prometheus.url=http://prometheus:9090
        - --grpc-address=0.0.0.0:10901
        - --http-address=0.0.0.0:10902
        volumeMounts:
        - name: prometheus-data
          mountPath: /var/prometheus
      volumes:
      - name: prometheus-data
        emptyDir: {}
```

#### 2. Check Network Connectivity

Ensure your Kubernetes nodes can reach the image registry. You can test this by running a simple network check from within a pod:

```sh
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh
```

Inside the pod, try to ping the registry:

```sh
ping quay.io
```

#### 3. Authenticate with Registry

If the image is in a private registry, create a Kubernetes secret for Docker registry credentials:

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry myregistrykey \
  --docker-server=<your-registry-server> \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password> \
  --docker-email=<your-email>
```

Then, update your deployment to use this secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: thanos-sidecar
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: thanos-sidecar
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: thanos-sidecar
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: myregistrykey
      containers:
      - name: thanos-sidecar
        image: quay.io/thanos/thanos:v0.35.1
        args:
        - sidecar
        - --tsdb.path=/var/prometheus
        - --prometheus.url=http://prometheus:9090
        - --grpc-address=0.0.0.0:10901
        - --http-address=0.0.0.0:10902
        volumeMounts:
        - name: prometheus-data
          mountPath: /var/prometheus
      volumes:
      - name: prometheus-data
        emptyDir: {}
```

### Apply the Changes

1. **Apply the Updated Deployment**:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Check Pod Status**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n monitoring
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   ```sh
   kubectl logs thanos-sidecar-<pod-id> -n monitoring
   ```

Ensure the pod is running and the container is able to pull the image successfully.



After update stiull the same error

I understand that you're still encountering the same error after updating the Thanos sidecar deployment. Let's investigate further to identify the root cause of the image pull failure. Here are some additional steps we can take:

1. Check the detailed event logs for the pod:

```sh
kubectl describe pod thanos-sidecar-5fdb4b74f8-9mf2f -n monitoring
```

Look for any specific error messages in the events section at the bottom of the output. This might provide more information about why the image pull is failing.

2. Verify that the image exists and is accessible:

Try pulling the image manually on one of your cluster nodes or on a machine with similar network access:

```sh
docker pull quay.io/thanos/thanos:v0.35.1
```

If this fails, it could indicate a network or registry access issue.

3. Check if there are any ImagePullBackOff errors:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n monitoring | grep ImagePullBackOff
```

4. Verify your cluster's ability to pull images:

Try creating a pod with a simple, public image to ensure your cluster can pull images in general:

```yaml:test-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-container
    image: nginx:latest
```

Apply this with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f test-pod.yaml -n monitoring
```

Then check its status:

```sh
kubectl get pod test-pod -n monitoring
```

5. Check for any cluster-wide network policies or restrictions that might be preventing image pulls.

6. Ensure that your nodes have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to pull and run the containers.

7. If you're using a private cluster or have restricted network access, you might need to configure a pull-through cache or a local registry mirror.

8. Check if there are any proxy settings that need to be configured for your cluster to access external resources.

After performing these checks, please provide the output of the `kubectl describe pod` command and any other relevant information you find. This will help us pinpoint the exact cause of the image pull failure and provide a more targeted solution.

Based on the output you provided, there are a few issues that are causing the image pull to fail. Let's address them one by one:

1. Docker daemon connection issue:
```
Warning  InspectFailed   3m40s  kubelet  Failed to inspect image "quay.io/thanos/thanos:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```
This error suggests that the kubelet is unable to connect to the Docker daemon. Since you're using Minikube, this might be due to the container runtime configuration.

2. Image not found:
```
Warning  Failed  3m3s (x3 over 3m56s)  kubelet  Failed to pull image "quay.io/thanos/thanos:latest": Error response from daemon: manifest for quay.io/thanos/thanos:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```
This error indicates that the `latest` tag for the Thanos image is not available or cannot be found.

To resolve these issues, try the following steps:

1. Use a specific version tag instead of `latest`:
Update your deployment YAML to use a specific version of Thanos. For example:

```yaml:thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml
// ... existing code ...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: thanos-sidecar
    image: quay.io/thanos/thanos:v0.35.1  # Use a specific version instead of 'latest'
// ... existing code ...
```

2. Verify Minikube's container runtime:
Check which container runtime Minikube is using:

```sh
minikube profile list
```

If it's not using Docker, you might want to start Minikube with Docker specifically:

```sh
minikube start --driver=docker
```

3. Ensure Minikube has internet access:
Try pulling an image manually within Minikube:

```sh
minikube ssh
docker pull quay.io/thanos/thanos:v0.35.1
```

If this fails, it could indicate network issues within Minikube.

4. Update and restart Minikube:
Sometimes, updating Minikube and restarting it can resolve issues:

```sh
minikube stop
minikube delete
minikube start --driver=docker
```

5. Apply the updated deployment:
After making these changes, apply the updated deployment:

```sh
kubectl apply -f thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml -n monitoring
```

6. Check the pod status again:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl describe pod <thanos-sidecar-pod-name> -n monitoring
```

These steps should help resolve the image pull issues. If you're still encountering problems, please provide the output of these commands, especially the result of manually pulling the image within Minikube and the updated pod description after applying these changes.
