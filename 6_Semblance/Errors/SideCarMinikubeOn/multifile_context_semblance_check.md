rifaterdemsahin: why does the side car does not work

GitHub Copilot: To diagnose why the Thanos sidecar is not working, follow these steps:

1. **Check Pod Logs**:
   - Inspect the logs of the Thanos sidecar pod to get more details about the error.
   ```sh
   kubectl logs thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-mkjpq -n monitoring
   ```
   @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/PrometheusThanosConnection (main) $    kubectl logs thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-mkjpq -n monitoring

2. **Describe the Pod**:
   - You have already described the pod, and it shows a [`CrashLoopBackOff`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2FPrometheusThanosConnection%2F4_Formulas%2FClusterDebug%2Fclusterdebug.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A57%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2FPrometheusThanosConnection%2F6_Semblance%2FErrors%2FSideCarMinikubeOn%2Fsidecar-deployment.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A57%7D%7D%5D%2C%22dbc1b312-3427-4903-9f9a-cf5daa84a514%22%5D "Go to definition") state. This usually indicates that the container is repeatedly failing and restarting.
   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod thanos-sidecar-68996566c8-mkjpq -n monitoring
   ```

3. **Check Resource Requests and Limits**:
   - Ensure that the pod has sufficient resources allocated.
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.spec.containers[*].resources}{"\n"}{end}' -n monitoring
   ```

4. **Check Events**:
   - Look at the events to see if there are any clues about why the pod is failing.
   ```sh
   kubectl get events --namespace=monitoring
   ```

5. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the configuration files (

thanos-sidecar-deployment.yaml

 and 

thanos-sidecar-service.yaml

) are correct and that the image version is compatible.

6. **Check Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that the Prometheus instance is running and accessible from the Thanos sidecar.
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n monitoring
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to gather enough information to identify and resolve the issue with the Thanos sidecar.
